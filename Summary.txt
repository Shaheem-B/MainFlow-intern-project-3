Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Project Overview:
âž©This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral 
data. By grouping customers with similar characteristics, businesses can enhance targeted marketing 
strategies, customer engagement, and personalized recommendations.

Key Steps & Implementation:
1)Data Loading & Exploration:
âž©The dataset is loaded from an Excel file using Pandas.
âž©Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, including checking missing values, duplicates,
data types, and summary statistics.

2)Data Preprocessing & Standardization:
âž©Relevant numerical features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, Work Experience, Family Size) are 
selected.
âž©Data is standardized using StandardScaler to ensure fair clustering.

3)Optimal Cluster Selection:
âž©Elbow Method: Plots Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different cluster sizes to determine the i
deal number of clusters.
âž©Silhouette Score: Measures clustering quality for different values of k (number of clusters) and 
selects the best-performing cluster count.

4)Applying K-Means Clustering:
âž©The K-Means algorithm is applied with the optimal k value, and each customer is assigned a cluster label.

5)Data Visualization:
âž©PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensionality and visualizes clusters in a 2D scatter plot.
âž©t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Another dimensionality reduction technique for
high-dimensional data visualization.
âž©Pair Plots: Displays relationships between different features and cluster distributions.
âž©Centroid Plot: Shows the standardized values of cluster centroids to analyze feature importance.

6)Technologies & Tools Used:
âž©Python â€“ Primary programming language.
âž©Pandas â€“ For data handling and preprocessing.
âž©Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ For data visualization.
âž©Scikit-Learn (sklearn) â€“ For machine learning tasks, including K-Means clustering, PCA, t-SNE, 
StandardScaler, and Silhouette Score analysis.

7)Results & Insights:
âž©Customers are successfully segmented into distinct clusters based on their behavior and demographics.
âž©Visualizations help in identifying key customer traits within each segment.
âž©Businesses can use these insights for personalized marketing, improved customer engagement, and 
optimized service offerings.

8)Conclusion:
âž©This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to customer segmentation, providing 
valuable insights for business decision-making. By leveraging K-Means clustering and advanced visualization 
techniques, companies can enhance their understanding of customer groups and refine their marketing
strategies effectively. ðŸš€
